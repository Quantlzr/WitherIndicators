### What it does:
This detects all 4 bosses from the revamped version of Catacomb Floor 7 (Maxor, Storm, Goldor, Necron) in order to display their different hit phases, abilities and advanced health bar.

### Why is this useful?
Due to the recent revamp of floor 7, players are in the dark about the mechanics they may encounter. As such, this mod will help you get a better understanding of what is going on by giving various alerts concerning boss abilities, phases and other indicators. It also has solvers for all of the new terminals.

### Is this bannable?
This mod is completely allowed as it only renders the boss room you are presently occupying.


### Hotkeys:
(Configurable in Controls Menu)
 - K - Toggle mod features on/off.
 
### Commands:
 - /wi - Opens the configuration GUI of the mod.
 - /wi reload - Re-render the room you are currently occupying.
 - /wi layout - Customize the layout of the mod displays as you wish.
