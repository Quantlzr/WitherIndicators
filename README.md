### What it does:
This detects all 4 bosses from the revamped version of Catacomb Floor 7 (Maxor, Storm, Goldor, Necron) in order to display their different hit phases, abilities and advanced health bar.  

### Why is this useful?
Due to the recent revamp of floor 7, players are in the dark about the mechanics they may encounter. As such, this mod will help you get a better understanding of what is going on by giving various alerts concerning boss abilities, phases and other indicators.

### Is this bannable?
This mod is completely allowed as it only renders the boss room you are presently occupying.
